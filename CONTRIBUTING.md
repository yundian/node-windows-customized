## NGN

node-windows/mac/linux were built to support [NGN](http://ngn.js.org). NGN is a Node.js-based microservice platform.
In accordance to the Microservice/POA/SOA approach, it uses multiple independent but connected processes to support apps/systems.
These processes are controlled with the node-* modules.

It has been in the works for almost 3yrs and is slated for a mid-late 2017 release. The node-* series
will progress in accordance to milestone accomplishments with NGN (which should be plentiful soon).
